# The networkData section is needed only for Ubuntu VMs. 
# In KubeVirt, the MAC address changes after a VM restart. Ubuntu retains this MAC address in its network settings, so after rebooting, these MAC addresses won't match the previous ones. 

# To overcome this behaviour of Ubuntu it is recommended to use cloud-init which would initiate a DHCP call. More details here, https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues/1646#issuecomment-433262034
